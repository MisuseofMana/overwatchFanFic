                There are a lot of reasons the government would want to destroy all bees. Let's get right into it. We're here to expose the truth.
            </h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Bees are destroying the high fructose corn syrup industry, and the government wants all competition gone.</li>
                <li>Bees threaten the dictatorship, they have Oligarchy Queens and big government doesn't like that.</li>
                <li>The president has health care plans that don't cover bee stings, so bees are a big no-no.</li>
                <li>Without bees then all plants die, which means that fossil fuels will be our only form of fuel over corn ethenol.</li>
                <li>They think bees are ugly.</li>
                <li>Bees are tough, and will help during civilian uprisings, so big GOV is trying to thin them out in preemptive quelling.</li>
                <li>Bees are technically immigrants, so you know. ;(</li>
                <li>They think bees are part of a gang and the government doesn't like gangs.</li>
                <li>The head of the FBI is allergic and wants his enemies eradicated so that he becomes unstoppable.</li>
                <li>Unfortunately, a wasp dressed like a bee shot JFK. <strong>Don't trust wasps.</strong></li>
                <li>Bees don't pay taxes because they don't understand the concept of currency.  The government wants what "it's owed".</li>
            </ol>
